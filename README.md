### **2. Problem Statement**

- Probem Statement-

  Dark Sky Finder: Design a solution to identify the best dark-sky locations nearby for stargazing or astronomical observations, using light pollution data.

- Briefly explain why you chose this problem and why itâ€™s important-

   Our similar interest in astronomy and stargazing has driven us toward this problem statement as this is one of the major problems we face as Stargazing enthusiasts, so we always wanted a solution, so why not build one?

  

### **3. Solution Overview**

- Overview:

 -A web application that displays pre-highlighted stargazing locations on an interactive map of India.

 -Provides real-time data on AQI, light pollution, and wind speed for each location.

 -Suggests whether the conditions are favorable for stargazing.

 -Allows users to search for a location directly on Google for further exploration.

- Core Idea:

 Solves the problem of identifying stargazing spots by integrating environmental data and user-friendly maps.

- How It Addresses the Problem:

 Empowers users to plan trips to dark-sky locations with reliable data.

### **4. Tech Stack**

 We are using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript alongside React.js to build a dynamic and responsive website. 
 
 Leaflet.js will power the interactive map, while APIs like OpenWeatherMap and Light Pollution API provide real-time environmental data. 
 
 Node.js handles backend operations, and the project will be hosted on Vercel or Netlify. 
 
 These tools are chosen for their efficiency and ability to deliver accurate and user-friendly results.

### **5. Implementation Plan**

- RoadMap Plan

  Finding the best problem statement out of the given statements. Find Out which one is closer to our interests and skills

  Assessing the resourses to findout out what we need for the project and what we have in our hands

  Plan usage of each resource in each domain, Usage of each tool, framework and language in different scenarios

  Creating a user optimized programme which serves the main purpose!!

  Turning the entire project into chunks which we can treat separately using trial and error method

  Using the planned resources to create demo pieces of our planned project

- Milestones:

  Map with highlighted locations.

  Pop-up clouds displaying environmental data.

  Real-time stargazing condition evaluation.

  Google search integration.

### **6. Expected Outcome**

- Achievements:

  A user-friendly website to explore the best stargazing locations in India.

  Accurate, real-time environmental data for informed decision-making.

  Increased awareness about light pollution and its effects on astronomy.
- Impact:

  Encourages stargazing and promotes science engagement.

  Offers practical utility for astronomy enthusiasts and tourists.
